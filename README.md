### Quick History/Timeline of Cloud Computing

- **1960s**: The concept of utility computing emerges.
- **1990s**: Telecommunications companies begin offering virtual private network (VPN) services.
- **2000s**: Amazon Web Services (AWS) launches in 2006, marking the start of modern cloud computing.
- **2010s**: The cloud market expands with offerings from Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud.
- **2020s**: Cloud computing becomes integral to businesses worldwide.

### What Can You Do with Cloud Computing?

Cloud computing enables various functionalities, such as:
- **Data Storage**: One of the most popular uses, store and access data from anywhere.
- **Scalability**: Easily adjust computing resources based on demand.
- **Development and Testing**: Create and test applications without physical infrastructure.
- **AI and Machine Learning**: Implement advanced technologies without massive investments.

### What is "On-Prem"?

"On-Prem" (On-Premises) refers to the more traditional computing systems where hardware and software are deployed within a company's physical location, rather than using cloud services.

### 4 Types of Cloud

1. **Public Cloud**: Services provided by third-party vendors, accessible over the internet.
2. **Private Cloud**: Cloud resources used exclusively by a single organization.
3. **Hybrid Cloud**: A combination of public and private clouds, allowing data and application portability.
4. **Multi-Cloud**: Use of multiple cloud providers to avoid vendor lock-in and enhance reliability.

### Different Types of Cloud Service

- **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**: Offers virtualized computing resources.
- **Platform as a Service (PaaS)**: Provides a platform and environment for application development.
- **Software as a Service (SaaS)**: Delivers software applications over the internet.
